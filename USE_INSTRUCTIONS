Just start it up and start using it.

The weather information is shown on a generated bubble when the application
tray icon is moused over.

Currently there is no GUI window to change application settings and hence they
have to manually be set.Options can be set by running the application atleast
once and then opening and set various settings in a config file located at:
~/.config/shaman-qt/shaman-qt.conf
